/*
3.  Invoking the Script

3.1.  Server Responsibilities

   The server acts as an application gateway.  It receives the request
   from the client, selects a CGI script to handle the request, converts
   the client request to a CGI request, executes the script and converts
   the CGI response into a response for the client.  When processing the
   client request, it is responsible for implementing any protocol or
   transport level authentication and security.  The server MAY also
   function in a 'non-transparent' manner, modifying the request or
   response in order to provide some additional service, such as media
   type transformation or protocol reduction.

   The server MUST perform translations and protocol conversions on the
   client request data required by this specification.  Furthermore, the
   server retains its responsibility to the client to conform to the
   relevant network protocol even if the CGI script fails to conform to
   this specification.

   If the server is applying authentication to the request, then it MUST
   NOT execute the script unless the request passes all defined access
   controls.

RFC 3875                    CGI Version 1.1                 October 2004


3.2.  Script Selection

   The server determines which CGI is script to be executed based on a
   generic-form URI supplied by the client.  This URI includes a
   hierarchical path with components separated by "/".  For any
   particular request, the server will identify all or a leading part of
   this path with an individual script, thus placing the script at a
   particular point in the path hierarchy.  The remainder of the path,
   if any, is a resource or sub-resource identifier to be interpreted by
   the script.

   Information about this split of the path is available to the script
   in the meta-variables, described below.  Support for non-hierarchical
   URI schemes is outside the scope of this specification.

3.3.  The Script-URI

   The mapping from client request URI to choice of script is defined by
   the particular server implementation and its configuration.  The
   server may allow the script to be identified with a set of several
   different URI path hierarchies, and therefore is permitted to replace
   the URI by other members of this set during processing and generation
   of the meta-variables.  The server

      1. MAY preserve the URI in the particular client request; or

      2. it MAY select a canonical URI from the set of possible values
         for each script; or

      3. it can implement any other selection of URI from the set.

   From the meta-variables thus generated, a URI, the 'Script-URI', can
   be constructed.  This MUST have the property that if the client had
   accessed this URI instead, then the script would have been executed
   with the same values for the SCRIPT_NAME, PATH_INFO and QUERY_STRING
   meta-variables.  The Script-URI has the structure of a generic URI as
   defined in section 3 of RFC 2396 [2], with the exception that object
   parameters and fragment identifiers are not permitted.  The various
   components of the Script-URI are defined by some of the
   meta-variables (see below);

      script-URI = <scheme> "://" <server-name> ":" <server-port>
                   <script-path> <extra-path> "?" <query-string>

   where <scheme> is found from SERVER_PROTOCOL, <server-name>,
   <server-port> and <query-string> are the values of the respective
   meta-variables.  The SCRIPT_NAME and PATH_INFO values, URL-encoded
   with ";", "=" and "?"  reserved, give <script-path> and <extra-path>.



Robinson & Coar              Informational                      [Page 9]

RFC 3875                    CGI Version 1.1                 October 2004


   See section 4.1.5 for more information about the PATH_INFO
   meta-variable.

   The scheme and the protocol are not identical as the scheme
   identifies the access method in addition to the application protocol.
   For example, a resource accessed using Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   [14] would have a request URI with a scheme of https when using the
   HTTP protocol [19].  CGI/1.1 provides no generic means for the script
   to reconstruct this, and therefore the Script-URI as defined includes
   the base protocol used.  However, a script MAY make use of
   scheme-specific meta-variables to better deduce the URI scheme.

   Note that this definition also allows URIs to be constructed which
   would invoke the script with any permitted values for the path-info
   or query-string, by modifying the appropriate components.

3.4.  Execution

   The script is invoked in a system-defined manner.  Unless specified
   otherwise, the file containing the script will be invoked as an
   executable program.  The server prepares the CGI request as described
   in section 4; this comprises the request meta-variables (immediately
   available to the script on execution) and request message data.  The
   request data need not be immediately available to the script; the
   script can be executed before all this data has been received by the
   server from the client.  The response from the script is returned to
   the server as described in sections 5 and 6.

   In the event of an error condition, the server can interrupt or
   terminate script execution at any time and without warning.  That
   could occur, for example, in the event of a transport failure between
   the server and the client; so the script SHOULD be prepared to handle
   abnormal termination.

4.  The CGI Request

   Information about a request comes from two different sources; the
   request meta-variables and any associated message-body.

4.1.  Request Meta-Variables

   Meta-variables contain data about the request passed from the server
   to the script, and are accessed by the script in a system-defined
   manner.  Meta-variables are identified by case-insensitive names;
   there cannot be two different variables whose names differ in case
   only.  Here they are shown using a canonical representation of
   capitals plus underscore ("_").  A particular system can define a
   different representation.



Robinson & Coar              Informational                     [Page 10]

RFC 3875                    CGI Version 1.1                 October 2004


      meta-variable-name = "AUTH_TYPE" | "CONTENT_LENGTH" |
                           "CONTENT_TYPE" | "GATEWAY_INTERFACE" |
                           "PATH_INFO" | "PATH_TRANSLATED" |
                           "QUERY_STRING" | "REMOTE_ADDR" |
                           "REMOTE_HOST" | "REMOTE_IDENT" |
                           "REMOTE_USER" | "REQUEST_METHOD" |
                           "SCRIPT_NAME" | "SERVER_NAME" |
                           "SERVER_PORT" | "SERVER_PROTOCOL" |
                           "SERVER_SOFTWARE" | scheme |
                           protocol-var-name | extension-var-name
      protocol-var-name  = ( protocol | scheme ) "_" var-name
      scheme             = alpha *( alpha | digit | "+" | "-" | "." )
      var-name           = token
      extension-var-name = token

   Meta-variables with the same name as a scheme, and names beginning
   with the name of a protocol or scheme (e.g., HTTP_ACCEPT) are also
   defined.  The number and meaning of these variables may change
   independently of this specification.  (See also section 4.1.18.)

   The server MAY set additional implementation-defined extension meta-
   variables, whose names SHOULD be prefixed with "X_".

   This specification does not distinguish between zero-length (NULL)
   values and missing values.  For example, a script cannot distinguish
   between the two requests http://host/script and http://host/script?
   as in both cases the QUERY_STRING meta-variable would be NULL.

      meta-variable-value = "" | 1*<TEXT, CHAR or tokens of value>

   An optional meta-variable may be omitted (left unset) if its value is
   NULL.  Meta-variable values MUST be considered case-sensitive except
   as noted otherwise.  The representation of the characters in the
   meta-variables is system-defined; the server MUST convert values to
   that representation.

4.1.1.  AUTH_TYPE

   The AUTH_TYPE variable identifies any mechanism used by the server to
   authenticate the user.  It contains a case-insensitive value defined
   by the client protocol or server implementation.

   For HTTP, if the client request required authentication for external
   access, then the server MUST set the value of this variable from the
   'auth-scheme' token in the request Authorization header field.






Robinson & Coar              Informational                     [Page 11]

RFC 3875                    CGI Version 1.1                 October 2004


      AUTH_TYPE      = "" | auth-scheme
      auth-scheme    = "Basic" | "Digest" | extension-auth
      extension-auth = token

   HTTP access authentication schemes are described in RFC 2617 [5].

4.1.2.  CONTENT_LENGTH

   The CONTENT_LENGTH variable contains the size of the message-body
   attached to the request, if any, in decimal number of octets.  If no
   data is attached, then NULL (or unset).

      CONTENT_LENGTH = "" | 1*digit

   The server MUST set this meta-variable if and only if the request is
   accompanied by a message-body entity.  The CONTENT_LENGTH value must
   reflect the length of the message-body after the server has removed
   any transfer-codings or content-codings.

4.1.3.  CONTENT_TYPE

   If the request includes a message-body, the CONTENT_TYPE variable is
   set to the Internet Media Type [6] of the message-body.

      CONTENT_TYPE = "" | media-type
      media-type   = type "/" subtype *( ";" parameter )
      type         = token
      subtype      = token
      parameter    = attribute "=" value
      attribute    = token
      value        = token | quoted-string

   The type, subtype and parameter attribute names are not
   case-sensitive.  Parameter values may be case sensitive.  Media types
   and their use in HTTP are described section 3.7 of the HTTP/1.1
   specification [4].

   There is no default value for this variable.  If and only if it is
   unset, then the script MAY attempt to determine the media type from
   the data received.  If the type remains unknown, then the script MAY
   choose to assume a type of application/octet-stream or it may reject
   the request with an error (as described in section 6.3.3).

   Each media-type defines a set of optional and mandatory parameters.
   This may include a charset parameter with a case-insensitive value
   defining the coded character set for the message-body.  If the





Robinson & Coar              Informational                     [Page 12]

RFC 3875                    CGI Version 1.1                 October 2004


   charset parameter is omitted, then the default value should be
   derived according to whichever of the following rules is the first to
   apply:

      1. There MAY be a system-defined default charset for some
         media-types.

      2. The default for media-types of type "text" is ISO-8859-1 [4].

      3. Any default defined in the media-type specification.

      4. The default is US-ASCII.

   The server MUST set this meta-variable if an HTTP Content-Type field
   is present in the client request header.  If the server receives a
   request with an attached entity but no Content-Type header field, it
   MAY attempt to determine the correct content type, otherwise it
   should omit this meta-variable.

4.1.4.  GATEWAY_INTERFACE

   The GATEWAY_INTERFACE variable MUST be set to the dialect of CGI
   being used by the server to communicate with the script.  Syntax:

      GATEWAY_INTERFACE = "CGI" "/" 1*digit "." 1*digit

   Note that the major and minor numbers are treated as separate
   integers and hence each may be incremented higher than a single
   digit.  Thus CGI/2.4 is a lower version than CGI/2.13 which in turn
   is lower than CGI/12.3.  Leading zeros MUST be ignored by the script
   and MUST NOT be generated by the server.

   This document defines the 1.1 version of the CGI interface.

4.1.5.  PATH_INFO

   The PATH_INFO variable specifies a path to be interpreted by the CGI
   script.  It identifies the resource or sub-resource to be returned by
   the CGI script, and is derived from the portion of the URI path
   hierarchy following the part that identifies the script itself.
   Unlike a URI path, the PATH_INFO is not URL-encoded, and cannot
   contain path-segment parameters.  A PATH_INFO of "/" represents a
   single void path segment.

      PATH_INFO = "" | ( "/" path )
      path      = lsegment *( "/" lsegment )
      lsegment  = *lchar
      lchar     = <any TEXT or CTL except "/">



Robinson & Coar              Informational                     [Page 13]

RFC 3875                    CGI Version 1.1                 October 2004


   The value is considered case-sensitive and the server MUST preserve
   the case of the path as presented in the request URI.  The server MAY
   impose restrictions and limitations on what values it permits for
   PATH_INFO, and MAY reject the request with an error if it encounters
   any values considered objectionable.  That MAY include any requests
   that would result in an encoded "/" being decoded into PATH_INFO, as
   this might represent a loss of information to the script.  Similarly,
   treatment of non US-ASCII characters in the path is system-defined.

   URL-encoded, the PATH_INFO string forms the extra-path component of
   the Script-URI (see section 3.3) which follows the SCRIPT_NAME part
   of that path.

4.1.6.  PATH_TRANSLATED

   The PATH_TRANSLATED variable is derived by taking the PATH_INFO
   value, parsing it as a local URI in its own right, and performing any
   virtual-to-physical translation appropriate to map it onto the
   server's document repository structure.  The set of characters
   permitted in the result is system-defined.

      PATH_TRANSLATED = *<any character>

   This is the file location that would be accessed by a request for

      <scheme> "://" <server-name> ":" <server-port> <extra-path>

   where <scheme> is the scheme for the original client request and
   <extra-path> is a URL-encoded version of PATH_INFO, with ";", "=" and
   "?"  reserved.  For example, a request such as the following:

      http://somehost.com/cgi-bin/somescript/this%2eis%2epath%3binfo

   would result in a PATH_INFO value of

      /this.is.the.path;info

   An internal URI is constructed from the scheme, server location and
   the URL-encoded PATH_INFO:

      http://somehost.com/this.is.the.path%3binfo

   This would then be translated to a location in the server's document
   repository, perhaps a filesystem path something like this:

      /usr/local/www/htdocs/this.is.the.path;info

   The value of PATH_TRANSLATED is the result of the translation.



Robinson & Coar              Informational                     [Page 14]

RFC 3875                    CGI Version 1.1                 October 2004


   The value is derived in this way irrespective of whether it maps to a
   valid repository location.  The server MUST preserve the case of the
   extra-path segment unless the underlying repository supports case-
   insensitive names.  If the repository is only case-aware, case-
   preserving, or case-blind with regard to document names, the server
   is not required to preserve the case of the original segment through
   the translation.

   The translation algorithm the server uses to derive PATH_TRANSLATED
   is implementation-defined; CGI scripts which use this variable may
   suffer limited portability.

   The server SHOULD set this meta-variable if the request URI includes
   a path-info component.  If PATH_INFO is NULL, then the
   PATH_TRANSLATED variable MUST be set to NULL (or unset).

4.1.7.  QUERY_STRING

   The QUERY_STRING variable contains a URL-encoded search or parameter
   string; it provides information to the CGI script to affect or refine
   the document to be returned by the script.

   The URL syntax for a search string is described in section 3 of RFC
   2396 [2].  The QUERY_STRING value is case-sensitive.

      QUERY_STRING = query-string
      query-string = *uric
      uric         = reserved | unreserved | escaped

   When parsing and decoding the query string, the details of the
   parsing, reserved characters and support for non US-ASCII characters
   depends on the context.  For example, form submission from an HTML
   document [18] uses application/x-www-form-urlencoded encoding, in
   which the characters "+", "&" and "=" are reserved, and the ISO
   8859-1 encoding may be used for non US-ASCII characters.

   The QUERY_STRING value provides the query-string part of the
   Script-URI.  (See section 3.3).

   The server MUST set this variable; if the Script-URI does not include
   a query component, the QUERY_STRING MUST be defined as an empty
   string ("").

4.1.8.  REMOTE_ADDR

   The REMOTE_ADDR variable MUST be set to the network address of the
   client sending the request to the server.




Robinson & Coar              Informational                     [Page 15]

RFC 3875                    CGI Version 1.1                 October 2004


      REMOTE_ADDR  = hostnumber
      hostnumber   = ipv4-address | ipv6-address
      ipv4-address = 1*3digit "." 1*3digit "." 1*3digit "." 1*3digit
      ipv6-address = hexpart [ ":" ipv4-address ]
      hexpart      = hexseq | ( [ hexseq ] "::" [ hexseq ] )
      hexseq       = 1*4hex *( ":" 1*4hex )

   The format of an IPv6 address is described in RFC 3513 [15].

4.1.9.  REMOTE_HOST

   The REMOTE_HOST variable contains the fully qualified domain name of
   the client sending the request to the server, if available, otherwise
   NULL.  Fully qualified domain names take the form as described in
   section 3.5 of RFC 1034 [17] and section 2.1 of RFC 1123 [12].
   Domain names are not case sensitive.

      REMOTE_HOST   = "" | hostname | hostnumber
      hostname      = *( domainlabel "." ) toplabel [ "." ]
      domainlabel   = alphanum [ *alphahypdigit alphanum ]
      toplabel      = alpha [ *alphahypdigit alphanum ]
      alphahypdigit = alphanum | "-"

   The server SHOULD set this variable.  If the hostname is not
   available for performance reasons or otherwise, the server MAY
   substitute the REMOTE_ADDR value.

4.1.10.  REMOTE_IDENT

   The REMOTE_IDENT variable MAY be used to provide identity information
   reported about the connection by an RFC 1413 [20] request to the
   remote agent, if available.  The server may choose not to support
   this feature, or not to request the data for efficiency reasons, or
   not to return available identity data.

      REMOTE_IDENT = *TEXT

   The data returned may be used for authentication purposes, but the
   level of trust reposed in it should be minimal.

4.1.11.  REMOTE_USER

   The REMOTE_USER variable provides a user identification string
   supplied by client as part of user authentication.

      REMOTE_USER = *TEXT





Robinson & Coar              Informational                     [Page 16]

RFC 3875                    CGI Version 1.1                 October 2004


   If the client request required HTTP Authentication [5] (e.g., the
   AUTH_TYPE meta-variable is set to "Basic" or "Digest"), then the
   value of the REMOTE_USER meta-variable MUST be set to the user-ID
   supplied.

4.1.12.  REQUEST_METHOD

   The REQUEST_METHOD meta-variable MUST be set to the method which
   should be used by the script to process the request, as described in
   section 4.3.

      REQUEST_METHOD   = method
      method           = "GET" | "POST" | "HEAD" | extension-method
      extension-method = "PUT" | "DELETE" | token

   The method is case sensitive.  The HTTP methods are described in
   section 5.1.1 of the HTTP/1.0 specification [1] and section 5.1.1 of
   the HTTP/1.1 specification [4].

4.1.13.  SCRIPT_NAME

   The SCRIPT_NAME variable MUST be set to a URI path (not URL-encoded)
   which could identify the CGI script (rather than the script's
   output).  The syntax is the same as for PATH_INFO (section 4.1.5)

      SCRIPT_NAME = "" | ( "/" path )

   The leading "/" is not part of the path.  It is optional if the path
   is NULL; however, the variable MUST still be set in that case.

   The SCRIPT_NAME string forms some leading part of the path component
   of the Script-URI derived in some implementation-defined manner.  No
   PATH_INFO segment (see section 4.1.5) is included in the SCRIPT_NAME
   value.

4.1.14.  SERVER_NAME

   The SERVER_NAME variable MUST be set to the name of the server host
   to which the client request is directed.  It is a case-insensitive
   hostname or network address.  It forms the host part of the
   Script-URI.

      SERVER_NAME = server-name
      server-name = hostname | ipv4-address | ( "[" ipv6-address "]" )







Robinson & Coar              Informational                     [Page 17]

RFC 3875                    CGI Version 1.1                 October 2004


   A deployed server can have more than one possible value for this
   variable, where several HTTP virtual hosts share the same IP address.
   In that case, the server would use the contents of the request's Host
   header field to select the correct virtual host.

4.1.15.  SERVER_PORT

   The SERVER_PORT variable MUST be set to the TCP/IP port number on
   which this request is received from the client.  This value is used
   in the port part of the Script-URI.

      SERVER_PORT = server-port
      server-port = 1*digit

   Note that this variable MUST be set, even if the port is the default
   port for the scheme and could otherwise be omitted from a URI.

4.1.16.  SERVER_PROTOCOL

   The SERVER_PROTOCOL variable MUST be set to the name and version of
   the application protocol used for this CGI request.  This MAY differ
   from the protocol version used by the server in its communication
   with the client.

      SERVER_PROTOCOL   = HTTP-Version | "INCLUDED" | extension-version
      HTTP-Version      = "HTTP" "/" 1*digit "." 1*digit
      extension-version = protocol [ "/" 1*digit "." 1*digit ]
      protocol          = token

   Here, 'protocol' defines the syntax of some of the information
   passing between the server and the script (the 'protocol-specific'
   features).  It is not case sensitive and is usually presented in
   upper case.  The protocol is not the same as the scheme part of the
   script URI, which defines the overall access mechanism used by the
   client to communicate with the server.  For example, a request that
   reaches the script with a protocol of "HTTP" may have used an "https"
   scheme.

   A well-known value for SERVER_PROTOCOL which the server MAY use is
   "INCLUDED", which signals that the current document is being included
   as part of a composite document, rather than being the direct target
   of the client request.  The script should treat this as an HTTP/1.0
   request.

4.1.17.  SERVER_SOFTWARE

   The SERVER_SOFTWARE meta-variable MUST be set to the name and version
   of the information server software making the CGI request (and
   running the gateway).  It SHOULD be the same as the server
   description reported to the client, if any.

      SERVER_SOFTWARE = 1*( product | comment )
      product         = token [ "/" product-version ]
      product-version = token
      comment         = "(" *( ctext | comment ) ")"
      ctext           = <any TEXT excluding "(" and ")">

4.1.18.  Protocol-Specific Meta-Variables

   The server SHOULD set meta-variables specific to the protocol and
   scheme for the request.  Interpretation of protocol-specific
   variables depends on the protocol version in SERVER_PROTOCOL.  The
   server MAY set a meta-variable with the name of the scheme to a
   non-NULL value if the scheme is not the same as the protocol.  The
   presence of such a variable indicates to a script which scheme is
   used by the request.

   Meta-variables with names beginning with "HTTP_" contain values read
   from the client request header fields, if the protocol used is HTTP.
   The HTTP header field name is converted to upper case, has all
   occurrences of "-" replaced with "_" and has "HTTP_" prepended to
   give the meta-variable name.  The header data can be presented as
   sent by the client, or can be rewritten in ways which do not change
   its semantics.  If multiple header fields with the same field-name
   are received then the server MUST rewrite them as a single value
   having the same semantics.  Similarly, a header field that spans
   multiple lines MUST be merged onto a single line.  The server MUST,
   if necessary, change the representation of the data (for example, the
   character set) to be appropriate for a CGI meta-variable.

   The server is not required to create meta-variables for all the
   header fields that it receives.  In particular, it SHOULD remove any
   header fields carrying authentication information, such as
   'Authorization'; or that are available to the script in other
   variables, such as 'Content-Length' and 'Content-Type'.  The server
   MAY remove header fields that relate solely to client-side
   communication issues, such as 'Connection'.

4.2.  Request Message-Body

   Request data is accessed by the script in a system-defined method;
   unless defined otherwise, this will be by reading the 'standard
   input' file descriptor or file handle.

      Request-Data   = [ request-body ] [ extension-data ]
      request-body   = <CONTENT_LENGTH>OCTET
      extension-data = *OCTET

   A request-body is supplied with the request if the CONTENT_LENGTH is
   not NULL.  The server MUST make at least that many bytes available
   for the script to read.  The server MAY signal an end-of-file
   condition after CONTENT_LENGTH bytes have been read or it MAY supply
   extension data.  Therefore, the script MUST NOT attempt to read more
   than CONTENT_LENGTH bytes, even if more data is available.  However,
   it is not obliged to read any of the data.

   For non-parsed header (NPH) scripts (section 5), the server SHOULD
   attempt to ensure that the data supplied to the script is precisely
   as supplied by the client and is unaltered by the server.

   As transfer-codings are not supported on the request-body, the server
   MUST remove any such codings from the message-body, and recalculate
   the CONTENT_LENGTH.  If this is not possible (for example, because of
   large buffering requirements), the server SHOULD reject the client
   request.  It MAY also remove content-codings from the message-body.

4.3.  Request Methods

   The Request Method, as supplied in the REQUEST_METHOD meta-variable,
   identifies the processing method to be applied by the script in
   producing a response.  The script author can choose to implement the
   methods most appropriate for the particular application.  If the
   script receives a request with a method it does not support it SHOULD
   reject it with an error (see section 6.3.3).

4.3.1.  GET

   The GET method indicates that the script should produce a document
   based on the meta-variable values.  By convention, the GET method is
   'safe' and 'idempotent' and SHOULD NOT have the significance of
   taking an action other than producing a document.

   The meaning of the GET method may be modified and refined by
   protocol-specific meta-variables.





Robinson & Coar              Informational                     [Page 20]

RFC 3875                    CGI Version 1.1                 October 2004


4.3.2.  POST

   The POST method is used to request the script perform processing and
   produce a document based on the data in the request message-body, in
   addition to meta-variable values.  A common use is form submission in
   HTML [18], intended to initiate processing by the script that has a
   permanent affect, such a change in a database.

   The script MUST check the value of the CONTENT_LENGTH variable before
   reading the attached message-body, and SHOULD check the CONTENT_TYPE
   value before processing it.

4.3.3.  HEAD

   The HEAD method requests the script to do sufficient processing to
   return the response header fields, without providing a response
   message-body.  The script MUST NOT provide a response message-body
   for a HEAD request.  If it does, then the server MUST discard the
   message-body when reading the response from the script.

4.3.4.  Protocol-Specific Methods

   The script MAY implement any protocol-specific method, such as
   HTTP/1.1 PUT and DELETE; it SHOULD check the value of SERVER_PROTOCOL
   when doing so.

   The server MAY decide that some methods are not appropriate or
   permitted for a script, and may handle the methods itself or return
   an error to the client.

6.  CGI Response

6.1.  Response Handling

   A script MUST always provide a non-empty response, and so there is a
   system-defined method for it to send this data back to the server.
   Unless defined otherwise, this will be via the 'standard output' file
   descriptor.

   The script MUST check the REQUEST_METHOD variable when processing the
   request and preparing its response.

   The server MAY implement a timeout period within which data must be
   received from the script.  If a server implementation defines such a
   timeout and receives no data from a script within the timeout period,
   the server MAY terminate the script process.

6.2.  Response Types

   The response comprises a message-header and a message-body, separated
   by a blank line.  The message-header contains one or more header
   fields.  The body may be NULL.

      generic-response = 1*header-field NL [ response-body ]

   The script MUST return one of either a document response, a local
   redirect response or a client redirect (with optional document)
   response.  In the response definitions below, the order of header
   fields in a response is not significant (despite appearing so in the
   BNF).  The header fields are defined in section 6.3.

      CGI-Response = document-response | local-redir-response |
                     client-redir-response | client-redirdoc-response

6.2.1.  Document Response

   The CGI script can return a document to the user in a document
   response, with an optional error code indicating the success status
   of the response.

      document-response = Content-Type [ Status ] *other-field NL
                          response-body





Robinson & Coar              Informational                     [Page 23]

RFC 3875                    CGI Version 1.1                 October 2004


   The script MUST return a Content-Type header field.  A Status header
   field is optional, and status 200 'OK' is assumed if it is omitted.
   The server MUST make any appropriate modifications to the script's
   output to ensure that the response to the client complies with the
   response protocol version.

6.2.2.  Local Redirect Response

   The CGI script can return a URI path and query-string
   ('local-pathquery') for a local resource in a Location header field.
   This indicates to the server that it should reprocess the request
   using the path specified.

      local-redir-response = local-Location NL

   The script MUST NOT return any other header fields or a message-body,
   and the server MUST generate the response that it would have produced
   in response to a request containing the URL

      scheme "://" server-name ":" server-port local-pathquery

6.2.3.  Client Redirect Response

   The CGI script can return an absolute URI path in a Location header
   field, to indicate to the client that it should reprocess the request
   using the URI specified.

      client-redir-response = client-Location *extension-field NL

   The script MUST not provide any other header fields, except for
   server-defined CGI extension fields.  For an HTTP client request, the
   server MUST generate a 302 'Found' HTTP response message.

6.2.4.  Client Redirect Response with Document

   The CGI script can return an absolute URI path in a Location header
   field together with an attached document, to indicate to the client
   that it should reprocess the request using the URI specified.

      client-redirdoc-response = client-Location Status Content-Type
                                 *other-field NL response-body

   The Status header field MUST be supplied and MUST contain a status
   value of 302 'Found', or it MAY contain an extension-code, that is,
   another valid status code that means client redirection.  The server
   MUST make any appropriate modifications to the script's output to
   ensure that the response to the client complies with the response
   protocol version.



Robinson & Coar              Informational                     [Page 24]

RFC 3875                    CGI Version 1.1                 October 2004


6.3.  Response Header Fields

   The response header fields are either CGI or extension header fields
   to be interpreted by the server, or protocol-specific header fields
   to be included in the response returned to the client.  At least one
   CGI field MUST be supplied; each CGI field MUST NOT appear more than
   once in the response.  The response header fields have the syntax:

      header-field    = CGI-field | other-field
      CGI-field       = Content-Type | Location | Status
      other-field     = protocol-field | extension-field
      protocol-field  = generic-field
      extension-field = generic-field
      generic-field   = field-name ":" [ field-value ] NL
      field-name      = token
      field-value     = *( field-content | LWSP )
      field-content   = *( token | separator | quoted-string )

   The field-name is not case sensitive.  A NULL field value is
   equivalent to a field not being sent.  Note that each header field in
   a CGI-Response MUST be specified on a single line; CGI/1.1 does not
   support continuation lines.  Whitespace is permitted between the ":"
   and the field-value (but not between the field-name and the ":"), and
   also between tokens in the field-value.

6.3.1.  Content-Type

   The Content-Type response field sets the Internet Media Type [6] of
   the entity body.

      Content-Type = "Content-Type:" media-type NL

   If an entity body is returned, the script MUST supply a Content-Type
   field in the response.  If it fails to do so, the server SHOULD NOT
   attempt to determine the correct content type.  The value SHOULD be
   sent unmodified to the client, except for any charset parameter
   changes.

   Unless it is otherwise system-defined, the default charset assumed by
   the client for text media-types is ISO-8859-1 if the protocol is HTTP
   and US-ASCII otherwise.  Hence the script SHOULD include a charset
   parameter.  See section 3.4.1 of the HTTP/1.1 specification [4] for a
   discussion of this issue.








Robinson & Coar              Informational                     [Page 25]

RFC 3875                    CGI Version 1.1                 October 2004


6.3.2.  Location

   The Location header field is used to specify to the server that the
   script is returning a reference to a document rather than an actual
   document (see sections 6.2.3 and 6.2.4).  It is either an absolute
   URI (optionally with a fragment identifier), indicating that the
   client is to fetch the referenced document, or a local URI path
   (optionally with a query string), indicating that the server is to
   fetch the referenced document and return it to the client as the
   response.

      Location        = local-Location | client-Location
      client-Location = "Location:" fragment-URI NL
      local-Location  = "Location:" local-pathquery NL
      fragment-URI    = absoluteURI [ "#" fragment ]
      fragment        = *uric
      local-pathquery = abs-path [ "?" query-string ]
      abs-path        = "/" path-segments
      path-segments   = segment *( "/" segment )
      segment         = *pchar
      pchar           = unreserved | escaped | extra
      extra           = ":" | "@" | "&" | "=" | "+" | "$" | ","

   The syntax of an absoluteURI is incorporated into this document from
   that specified in RFC 2396 [2] and RFC 2732 [7].  A valid absoluteURI
   always starts with the name of scheme followed by ":"; scheme names
   start with a letter and continue with alphanumerics, "+", "-" or ".".
   The local URI path and query must be an absolute path, and not a
   relative path or NULL, and hence must start with a "/".

   Note that any message-body attached to the request (such as for a
   POST request) may not be available to the resource that is the target
   of the redirect.

6.3.3.  Status

   The Status header field contains a 3-digit integer result code that
   indicates the level of success of the script's attempt to handle the
   request.

      Status         = "Status:" status-code SP reason-phrase NL
      status-code    = "200" | "302" | "400" | "501" | extension-code
      extension-code = 3digit
      reason-phrase  = *TEXT

   Status code 200 'OK' indicates success, and is the default value
   assumed for a document response.  Status code 302 'Found' is used
   with a Location header field and response message-body.  Status code



Robinson & Coar              Informational                     [Page 26]

RFC 3875                    CGI Version 1.1                 October 2004


   400 'Bad Request' may be used for an unknown request format, such as
   a missing CONTENT_TYPE.  Status code 501 'Not Implemented' may be
   returned by a script if it receives an unsupported REQUEST_METHOD.

   Other valid status codes are listed in section 6.1.1 of the HTTP
   specifications [1], [4], and also the IANA HTTP Status Code Registry
   [8] and MAY be used in addition to or instead of the ones listed
   above.  The script SHOULD check the value of SERVER_PROTOCOL before
   using HTTP/1.1 status codes.  The script MAY reject with error 405
   'Method Not Allowed' HTTP/1.1 requests made using a method it does
   not support.

   Note that returning an error status code does not have to mean an
   error condition with the script itself.  For example, a script that
   is invoked as an error handler by the server should return the code
   appropriate to the server's error condition.

   The reason-phrase is a textual description of the error to be
   returned to the client for human consumption.

6.3.4.  Protocol-Specific Header Fields

   The script MAY return any other header fields that relate to the
   response message defined by the specification for the SERVER_PROTOCOL
   (HTTP/1.0 [1] or HTTP/1.1 [4]).  The server MUST translate the header
   data from the CGI header syntax to the HTTP header syntax if these
   differ.  For example, the character sequence for newline (such as
   UNIX's US-ASCII LF) used by CGI scripts may not be the same as that
   used by HTTP (US-ASCII CR followed by LF).

   The script MUST NOT return any header fields that relate to
   client-side communication issues and could affect the server's
   ability to send the response to the client.  The server MAY remove
   any such header fields returned by the client.  It SHOULD resolve any
   conflicts between header fields returned by the script and header
   fields that it would otherwise send itself.

6.3.5.  Extension Header Fields

   There may be additional implementation-defined CGI header fields,
   whose field names SHOULD begin with "X-CGI-".  The server MAY ignore
   (and delete) any unrecognised header fields with names beginning "X-
   CGI-" that are received from the script.

RFC 3875                    CGI Version 1.1                 October 2004


6.4.  Response Message-Body

   The response message-body is an attached document to be returned to
   the client by the server.  The server MUST read all the data provided
   by the script, until the script signals the end of the message-body
   by way of an end-of-file condition.  The message-body SHOULD be sent
   unmodified to the client, except for HEAD requests or any required
   transfer-codings, content-codings or charset conversions.

      response-body = *OCTET
